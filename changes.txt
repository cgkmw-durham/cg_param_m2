Line 1051: Switched 'np.empty' to 'np.zeros'
thetas = np.zeros(len(angles))

-----Use of np.empty results in an initalisation error as the resulting array can contain very large or small values, impacting the resulting bond angles.
-----Use of np.zeros ensures bond angle calculations have contributions only due to the bead coordinate.
